# HomogeneousSetsFinder


Homogeneous sets are interesting networks structures that are a generalization of the concept of network motifs. For more information about homogeneous sets visit:

We provide a generic pipeline that extracts homogeneous sets from any network using its adjacency matrix as an input. This is to be used with any future available connectomes or other biological networks such as transcriptional networks.
